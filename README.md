# My Cat Clicker
## Introduction:
This is my version of cat clicker that displays different cats and counts the number of times users click on a cat. 

- Required Libraries and dependencies:
  - KnockoutJs
  - Bootstrap

## Installation Instructions:
Open the `index.html` file using a web browser.

## Operating Instruction:
With the web page loaded with your web browser, from the siedbar pick a cat by clicking on the cat's name. This will display the cat's image, name and number of clicks; this is zero initially. 
click on the cat's image, each click will be added to the total number of click. In this case, as the total number of click increases the cat's title changes thus;

 - if clicks less than 10
      - title = Newborn
 - if clicks more than 10 but less than 50
      - title = Infant 
 - if clicks more than 50 but less than 100
      - title = Child
 - if clicks more than 100 but less than 200
      - title = Teen
 - if clicks more than 200 but less than 500
      - title = Adult
 - if clicks more than 500
      - title = Ninja
